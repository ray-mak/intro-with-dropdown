<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5).</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<h1>My Process</h1>
<p>This challenge was a bit more complicated than some of the previous challenges I've attempted. The actualy layout wasn't too difficult. The hard part was creating a navigation bar and dropdown with smooth transitions and adapting it to mobile. I used javascript to create transitions for the dropdowns and to close other open dropdowns when opening a new dropdown. After creating the nav bar and dropdowns for desktop, I had to design a hamburger menu for mobile. After I figured that out, coding the rest of the landing page was relatively straightfoward</p>

<h2>Built With</h2>
This was built with

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Vanilla JS

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to create a more "advanced" dropdown menu. I animated the dropdowns, and made sure that clicking a new dropdown would close other open dropdowns. This required some javascript. While writing the javascript I learned about data attributes. I found data attributes to be a good way to select elements and toggle their state.</p>
<p>I also learned how to create animated hamburger menus and how to make the navigation menu slide in on mobile. This was a good lesson on how to toggle classes using javascript and data attributes.</p>

<h2>Continued Development</h2>
<p>Overall I'm quite happy with what I've created. However, I do feel I used a lot of CSS, especially for the navigation bar/hamburger menu. I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to do this. I will continue to look for better ways to style the landing page and navigation menu.</p>
